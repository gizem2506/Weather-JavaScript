## Ä°mportant Note

- Sound has been added to the background of the project. It will start when you touch any point on the page. I wanted to give information so that the sound does not disturb you.
- I made two, I tried to use different technologies in both. I sent both projects.

## Weather App

- This weather website is developed using React.js (without Next.js). The project was written in JavaScript and CSS was used for user interface design. Weather data is retrieved from a data source in JSON format.
- I published the projects in Vercel, I am sharing the links, you can view them from there.

## Getting Started

- To start the project, first, use the "npm install" command in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Then, you can launch the application with the "npm start" command. This command will install the required modules for the project to run and then integrate weather data from the JSON source into the user interface.
